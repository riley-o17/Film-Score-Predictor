# Film Predictor
 Created advanced linear and logistic regression models to predict the gross sales of a movie at the box office and whether it will have a high IMDB rating or not


## Inspiration
This project aims to predict the gross of a movie through multivariate linear regression to inform stakeholders about profitability, as some highly grossing films result in huge net losses. We also aim to predict, through multivariate logistic regression, whether a movie will be highly rated on the IMDB platform to inform stakeholders of projected audience opinion. 

The economics of Hollywood and the international film industry is not always as straightforward as it seems. Movies that gross highly are not always profitable, even if they make more money than their production budget. Thus, actors, producers, and investing studios who’s salaries and pay have relationships to the profitability of movies are at risk.

Additionally, over the past several years, the movie industry has undergone other immense changes. Movie makers are faced with uncertainty regarding the success of their product—in the financial sense, but also in the sense of critics and public opinion. Our group was interested in performing an analysis on film data, as we all enjoy watching movies, but were also concerned with mitigating these risks regarding gross, profitability, and assessment of success for the concerned parties.
